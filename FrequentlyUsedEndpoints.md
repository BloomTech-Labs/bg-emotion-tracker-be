### Adding a User to a Club
- Use this to assign a user(staff) to a club

POST /clubs/club/{cid}/addUser/{uid}

with empty body

Example url
```
https://bg-emotion-tracker-be-b.herokuapp.com/clubs/club/22/addUser/8

Example url

### Removing a Member from a club 
- Member would be added to the corresponding Club when posting new memberReaction, if the member is in the club yet.
- So only the delete endpoint is documented here.

DELETE /clubs/club/{cid}/removeMember/{mid}

Example url
```
https://bg-emotion-tracker-be-b.herokuapp.com/clubs/club/21/removeMember/testmember1

##  Endpoints for Activities
### Posting new activity to club

POST /activities/activity/addclub/{clubid}

with body
```
{
    "activityname": "test"

If the activity name is not found in DB, a new activity is created.
Or if the frontend knows the activity ID, you can use this too:
```
{
    "activityid": 15;
}
```




## Endpoints for MembersReactions

    - memberid: testmember1
    - activityid: 13
    - clubid: 20
    - Emojivalue: 1F601 (means U+1F601)

        }
    ],

        }, 
        {

    ]
}
```
The above query shall return all reactions from testmember1 and testmember2 for their submissions for club 20's activity 13 and 14.


## CSV

### Endpoint for CSV upload

- This endpoint handles the import of a csv list of clubname, memberid.
- The csv file can include a first line describing fields like the one in test.csv
- or not having the firstline, which default to clubname, memberid.

- Note: the current csv feature in the frontend is a simple read to list instead of handling the csv file itself
    - If that would be used, regular endpoints handling jsons shall be used.
- This endpoint requires a body of form data with the csv file.

POST /csv/upload

with form-data body of
```
{
    file: {csvfile}
}
```
where {csvfile} is a file stream of the csv file.

- This feature can be tested in the Postman collection with the given test csv above.
- Frontend can implement a feature to handle file if this endpoint is going to be used. 

<br />

### Endpoint for CSV download
GET at /csv/download

- This is not a file served by the server, so if frontend want a pop up for your typical download on the internet, maybe a new library is needed.
