- Use this to assign a user(staff) to a club

POST /clubs/club/{cid}/addUser/{uid}

### Posting new activity to club

```
{
    "activityid": 15;
}
```




## Endpoints for MembersReactions

### Submitting a MemberReaction

    - memberid: testmember1
    - activityid: 13
    - clubid: 20
    - Emojivalue: 1F601 (means U+1F601)





<br />


### Searching for MemberReactions (Beta)
- Can be used as a way to query general feedbacks to a specific club activity.
- Can be used as a way to query how a particular member is doing.
- Could be used in fancy ways as comparisons against multiple club activities and/or members

POST /memberreactions/search?from={starttime}&to={endtime}

sample uri: /memberreactions/search?from=2020-04-01&to=2021-06-01

with sample body: 
```
{
    "activities": [
        {
            "clubid": 20,
            "activityid": 13,
        },
        {
            "clubid": 20,
            "activityid": 14,
        }
    ],
    "members": [
        {
            "memberid": "testmember1"
        }, 
        {
            "memberid": "testmember2"
        }
    ]
}
```
The above query shall return all reactions from testmember1 and testmember2 for their submissions for club 20's activity 13 and 14.

- Another endpoint that derives from the one above shall be made that would respond with formatted arrays specifically for plotting charts/analysis on the frontend.
    - restrict to club-activities to up to 1
        - A plot that compares how different members are feeling towards one specific club-activity 
    - restrict members to up to 1
        - A plot that compares how a single member feel towards different club-activities
