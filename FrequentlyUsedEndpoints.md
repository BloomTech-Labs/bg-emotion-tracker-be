### Adding a User to a Club
- Use this to assign a user(staff) to a club

POST /clubs/club/{cid}/addUser/{uid}

with empty body

Example url
```
https://bg-emotion-tracker-be-b.herokuapp.com/clubs/club/22/addUser/8
```
will add user with id 8 to club with id 22


<br />

### Removing a User from a club 

DELETE /clubs/club/{cid}/removeUser/{uid}

Example url
```
https://bg-emotion-tracker-be-b.herokuapp.com/clubs/club/22/removeUser/8
```

<br />


### Removing a Member from a club 
- Member would be added to the corresponding Club when posting new memberReaction, if the member is in the club yet.
- So only the delete endpoint is documented here.

DELETE /clubs/club/{cid}/removeMember/{mid}

Example url
```
https://bg-emotion-tracker-be-b.herokuapp.com/clubs/club/21/removeMember/testmember1
```

<br />

##  Endpoints for Activities
### Posting new activity to club

POST /activities/activity/addclub/{clubid}

with body
```
{
    "activityname": "test"
}
```
If the activity name is not found in DB, a new activity is created.
Or if the frontend knows the activity ID, you can use this too:
```
{
    "activityid": 15;
}
```




## Endpoints for MembersReactions

### Submitting a MemberReaction

POST /memberreactions/memberreaction/submit?mid={memberidvalue}&aid={activityid}&cid={clubid}&rx={reactionstring}

- Use empty body

Explanation with a example url:
- POST /memberreactions/memberreaction/submit?mid=testmember1&aid=13&cid=20&rx=1F601
    - memberid: testmember1
    - activityid: 13
    - clubid: 20
    - Emojivalue: 1F601 (means U+1F601)





<br />


### Searching for MemberReactions
- This endpoint returns a list of all memberReactions given filters for
   - members
   - clubActivities
   - time range

POST /memberreactions/search?from={starttime}&to={endtime}

sample uri: /memberreactions/search?from=2020-04-01&to=2021-06-01

with sample body: 
```
{
    "activities": [
        {
            "clubid": 20,
            "activityid": 13,
        },
        {
            "clubid": 20,
            "activityid": 14,
        }
    ],
    "members": [
        {
            "memberid": "testmember1"
        }, 
        {
            "memberid": "testmember2"
        }
    ]
}
```
The above query shall return all reactions from testmember1 and testmember2 for their submissions for club 20's activity 13 and 14.


## CSV

### Endpoint for CSV upload

- This endpoint handles the import of a csv list of clubname, memberid.
- The csv file can include a first line describing fields like the one in test.csv
- or not having the firstline, which default to clubname, memberid.

- Note: the current csv feature in the frontend is a simple read to list instead of handling the csv file itself
    - If that would be used, regular endpoints handling jsons shall be used.
- This endpoint requires a body of form data with the csv file.

POST /csv/upload

with form-data body of
```
{
    file: {csvfile}
}
```
where {csvfile} is a file stream of the csv file.

- This feature can be tested in the Postman collection with the given test csv above.
- Frontend can implement a feature to handle file if this endpoint is going to be used. 

<br />

### Endpoint for CSV download
GET at /csv/download

- This is not a file served by the server, so if frontend want a pop up for your typical download on the internet, maybe a new library is needed.
